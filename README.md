# Oxford Pets Diffusion Model (DDPM)

This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)
with an upgraded UNet architecture (Residual Blocks + Self-Attention)
trained on the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset (64×64 RGB).

The model was trained in Google Colab and later exported for version control.

## Features
- UNet with skip connections and residual blocks
- Self-attention at multiple resolutions
- Sinusoidal timestep embeddings
- Checkpointing and visualization during training
